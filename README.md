# Interactive Maps with Folium!

This lab includes a Python library called ‘Folium’ that allows users to build interactive maps. In this tutorial I learnt how to experiment with different features of Folium.
I first imported the needed libraries including folium, pandas and json and uploaded the data files to colab. The tutorial follows with code to make a chloropleth map of Starbucks locations in LA county. I explored with the basemap feature and changed the basemap.

The tutorial then follows with a better way to map Starbucks locations using latitude and longitude coordinates rather than zip codes. I used the code given in the tutorial to make the map and also changed the style such as the basemap to ‘OpenStreetMap’. I also changed the color and size of small markers from red to purple. I also made another map where I changed the marker style from circle to simple marker and passed code that allows users to click the marker and then it shows the location of the marker that users click on. I also changed the zoom starting level of the map in order to see the markers better. 

I also made the bonus chloropleth map which maps unemployment by state and I changed the color scheme to shades of yellow and red.
